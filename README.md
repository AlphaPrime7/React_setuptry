# Print Statement in React

- Unlike other programming languages, the print statement in web design and web programming is visual and so there must be a way to have real-time rendering of
components or code in order to see what changes in written code result in.
- I failed for a little while trying to accomplish this in React and finally got it to work.
- Also another big lesson here which I am used to but gets annoyed when you fail for a little bit is that seeing an error in the transcompiler for react does not constitute a failure.
- Finally I can see my work in real time as I progress into learning HTML, React and web ui design.
